# Data Structures and Algorithms Implementations
Here you can find my implementations of common Data Structures and Algorithms implemented on Python

* You can create issues if you have suggestions for additional Data Structures and Algortithms that could be implemented

* This repo could be used to quickly review common Data Structures and Algorithms (e.g. before interviews)

* If you want to add implementations of the data structures and algorithms in other languages, feel free to create a pull request

* Also, you are welcome to create pull requests that closes any open issues

## Requirements
You will need `Python 3.x` installed on your machine

## Info
Each file also contains tests

If you want to run the file, just execute the following command in the terminal:

For algorithms:

```
python3 /algorithms/<FILE_NAME>
```

For data structures:

```
python3 /DS/<FILE_NAME>
```
